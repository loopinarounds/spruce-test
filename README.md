# Tic-Tac-Toe

I went for a very simple Arcade game leaderboard approach for the challenge. Upon completing a game, you are given a form to enter your name for submission to the leaderboard. This then simply stores your name as a "win" with a unique id. The leaderboard then just generates as an acculmulation of all your games.

## Things I'd do with more time
 (wanted to stop here in order to stick close to the set time)

- Better game storage. Would be nicer to get the details of both players and store the board and winner, makes analytics a possibility

- Better UI on the board. I'd like to be able to show a preview of who's turn is next actually on the board. Alas it was being buggy and i ran out of time for it.

- Backend tests! Setting up a mock db and environment for testing was not something realistic for the time given.

## Quickstart
- Make sure you have **node** installed
- `cd client`
- `npm i`
- `npm start`

- In a second termina;
- `cd server`
- `npm i`
- `npm start`


`localhost:3001`
